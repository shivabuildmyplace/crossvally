            Bisley is a transitional custom home that blends traditional
            character with contemporary openness. The two-story great room
            features a fireplace that rises the full height of the space,
            establishing a timeless focal point and bringing a sense of vertical
            elegance to the main living area.
            <br />{" "}
            <h3>
              Natural light gently shapes the interiors, pouring into the great
              room through large windows and filtering through to the upper
              level. A window at the stair landing brings light into the
              vertical core of the home, while the open loft above offers both a
              visual connection to the living space below and a sense of
              openness that balances comfort with volume.
              <br /> The finished basement features two exposed structural
              beams, adding a touch of industrial character that contrasts with
              the home's tailored finishesâ€”bringing texture and visual interest
              to the lower level.
